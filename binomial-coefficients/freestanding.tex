\section*{Abstract}
We compare different techniques for modular multiplications, with a concrete application to computing binomial coefficients.

The paper is written from a competitive programming standpoint, with little regard to portability (all judges run GCC on Intel hardware).
The benchmarking performed is highly unscientific, with measurements being done on an old laptop running an i5-U4200 Haswell processor,
and times being eyeballed medians of relatively high-variance measurements.
That said, the overall conclusions should still be valid, and may be of interest outside of the competitive programming sphere as well.
