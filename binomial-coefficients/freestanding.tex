\section*{Abstract}
We compare different techniques for modular multiplications, and apply this to compute binomial coefficients quickly.

This paper is written as part of a future series about SIMD within competitive programming, based around different example problems.
However, it may be of interest outside of the competitive programming sphere as well.

\section{Introduction}

Modular multiplication comes up frequently within competitive programming,
and it is sometimes useful to be able to do it quickly, e.g. to get away
with bad time complexities.
Using binomial coefficient computation as a running example, we show how
to improve performance using data-parallel loops, SIMD and different
algorithms for modular multiplication.
We will first deal with the easy case of computing them mod $2^{32}$, and
then modulo arbitrary integers in the range $[1, 10^9]$.

As usual for competitive programming, we shall have
little regard to portability and assume GCC and x86\_64,
and use the following file header to keep code size down:

\begin{lstlisting}
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define rep(i,f,t) for (int i = (f); i < (t); i++)
typedef int64_t ll;
\end{lstlisting}

The benchmarking performed is highly unscientific,
with measurements being done on an old laptop running an i5-4200U Haswell processor,
and times eyeballed medians of relatively high-variance measurements.
That said, the overall conclusions should still be valid.
